<!-- Features -->
### :dart: Features

- ðŸ‘‰Create a model that will detect a car in an image and recognize characters on number plate of the car .
- ðŸ‘‰Secondly , it will use the characters and fetch the owners information using RTO APIâ€™s .
- ðŸ‘‰Create a Web portal where all this information will be displayed (using Html, Css, and Javascript).

<!-- Usage -->
## :eyes: Usage

This was a Final Year Project assigned to us by Biplab Mahapatra Sir.

In this task, we have created one Web UI in which you have to select and upload one of image of your carâ€™s number plate and then our webpage will display all the details about that car like owner name, date of registration, insurance, etc. For doing this task we have used following tools and technologies:-

i) Python (Flask framework, OpenCV module, absl, re, json, etc)

ii) Web Technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

iii) PaddleOCR

iv) Haarcascade Russian number plate model for number plate detection.

v) RTO Car Registration API
  
vi) Google Firebase(To store and retrive rto information of vehicles in database)



```javascript
import Component from 'my-project'

function App() {
  return <Component />
}
```

<!-- Roadmap -->
## :compass: Roadmap

* [1] First the code of flask will get run(app.py)
* [2] When user upload the image it get saved in S3 bucket.
* [3] When user upload the image it get saved in inputs folder.
* [4] The npr.py runs in backend and the number plate gets cropped and the ocr extracts the number plate in text and displays the result.
* [5] The result gets stored in json file and it is retrived to display in search history webpage.
* [6] The user can get details of the searched image from databse created in firebase in Rto information webpage.
* [2] The user can also add details of the car to database.
